# 🎵 HarmonIQ

This project is a **Music Recommendation System** built using Python, Flask, and machine learning techniques. It provides personalized music recommendations based on various audio features extracted from a dataset.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Cluster-based recommendations**: Uses K-Means clustering for grouping similar tracks.
- **Data analysis**: Insights into music trends by genres and years.
- **Web application**: A Flask-powered web interface for interaction.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphical insights using tools like Matplotlib and Plotly.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Libraries: Flask, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommendation-system.git
   cd music-recommendation-system
##💡 Usage


###🎧 Recommendation System:
  Enter track features or choose a track to receive recommendations.
  Results are displayed in the web app with key track details.
###📊 Analysis with Jupyter Notebook:
  Open recommender_model.ipynb to analyze data trends or modify the clustering logic.
###📂 Datasets:
  data.csv: Contains detailed track-level information.
  data_by_genres.csv: Aggregated data grouped by genres.
  data_by_year.csv: Aggregated data grouped by years.
###⚙️ How It Works
  ###Data Preprocessing:
    Filters relevant audio features such as valence, danceability, and tempo.
  ###Clustering:
    Groups tracks based on audio similarity using K-Means clustering.
  ###Recommendation:
    Finds the closest tracks to a user-selected track based on cluster similarity.
###🤝 Contribution Guidelines
  Fork the repository.
  Create a new branch for your feature:
    bash
      
    git checkout -b feature-name
  Commit your changes:
    bash

###🔮 Future Enhancements
  ###Here are some potential improvements that can be added to the project:

    ###Advanced Recommendation Techniques:

      Incorporate collaborative or content-based filtering algorithms for personalized recommendations.
    ###Real-time Data:

      Integrate APIs (like Spotify API) to fetch live data for recommendations.
    ###User Authentication:

      Add user login functionality to save preferences and track history.
    ###Enhanced Visualizations:

      Add interactive charts and dashboards for better insights.
