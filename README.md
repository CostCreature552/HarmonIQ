Music Recommendation System
This project is a Music Recommendation System built using Python, Flask, and machine learning techniques. It provides personalized music recommendations based on various audio features extracted from a dataset.

Features
Cluster-based recommendations: Uses K-Means clustering for grouping similar tracks.
Data analysis: Insights into music trends by genres and years.
Web application: A Flask-powered web interface for interaction.
Visualization: Generates graphical insights using tools like Matplotlib and Plotly.
Project Structure
Files and Folders
app.py:
Flask application serving as the main entry point.
Handles user input and recommendation logic.
Loads and preprocesses datasets (data.csv, data_by_year.csv).
recommender_model.ipynb:
Jupyter Notebook for developing and training the recommendation engine.
Includes steps for data preprocessing, clustering, and analysis.
Datasets:
data.csv: Contains detailed track information, such as artists, acoustic features, and popularity.
data_by_genres.csv: Aggregated data grouped by genres.
data_by_year.csv: Aggregated data grouped by years.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or later
Libraries: Flask, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommendation-system.git
cd music-recommendation-system
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the application in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Usage
Recommendation System:

Enter track features or choose a track to receive recommendations.
Results are displayed in the web app with key track details.
Analysis with Jupyter Notebook:

Open recommender_model.ipynb to analyze data trends or modify the clustering logic.
Datasets:

Use data.csv for detailed track-level analysis.
Use data_by_genres.csv and data_by_year.csv for aggregated insights.
How It Works
Data Preprocessing:
Filters relevant audio features such as valence, danceability, and tempo.
Clustering:
Groups tracks based on audio similarity using K-Means clustering.
Recommendation:
Finds the closest tracks to a user-selected track based on cluster similarity.
